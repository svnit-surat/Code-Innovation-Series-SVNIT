## Submission Procedure
Read the following steps and guidelines properly for proper submission of your project. Missing out any step or performing it wrongly can lead to unsuccessful submission. 

### Step 1
#### Fork this repository

### Step 2
#### Create a New Folder within the forked repository, with the 'folder name' being your 'Team Name'

## Contents of the folder

You can complete your work on the local machine and then upload your project folder in the forked repository and proceed to create a Pull Request.
