TEAM NAME : Mind Install

PROJECT NAME : Doubt Solver

PROBLEM STATEMENT : EduTech

DESCRIPTION :

In this project we have made a doubts solving platform like discussion forum in which students can
ask their doubts occured during online classes of different subjects to the respective teacher. So that
the student's doubts can be solved in time effective manner using technique called communication threads.

Why this app is different?

Normally when students have doubt regarding a topic, they use the messaging panel to communicate with the 
teacher. But the problem in this system is that if student has another doubt at the same time, then he
types it on the messaging panel which opens up an entire new conversation between an ongoing communication.
For that, we used messaging threads which helps students to create new threads (start new conversations)
and join existing threads (reply to old conversations). Each thread means a different topic, so the doubt 
solving process is carried out effectively. If in future another student has some doubt on a topic already 
discussed before he/she can continue to clear her doubts on respective thread instead of scrolling through
mixed long messages.
